📘 Overview
Welcome to my personal collection of Machine Learning projects. This repository reflects my practical journey through various domains of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and basic deep learning tasks. Each project highlights a real-world problem and presents data-driven solutions using modern techniques and algorithms.

📊 Projects
📚 00 - Learning ML Notebooks
Foundational notebooks I created while studying the core concepts of machine learning.

🍃 01 - CO2 Emission Prediction
Predicting vehicle CO2 emissions using fuel consumption and engine features via regression models like Simple Linear and Multiple Linear Regression.

🚗 02 - Car Price Prediction
Price estimation based on car features using regression techniques including Linear, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.

🍇 03 - Raisin Classification
Classifying raisin types (Kecimen and Besni) with various classification algorithms and feature engineering methods.

💸 04 - Income Prediction
Predicting whether a person earns more or less than $50K using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and SVM while handling class imbalance.

✍️ 05 - Handwritten Digit Recognition
Classifying handwritten digits using SVC, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, with a focus on performance comparison.

🚢 06 - Titanic Survival Prediction
Using Titanic dataset to predict survival using ensemble methods such as XGBoost, GradientBoost, and AdaBoost. Emphasis on feature engineering and performance metrics (F1-score, ROC-AUC, PRC).

🪖 07 - Soldier Ethnicity Classification (ANSUR II)
